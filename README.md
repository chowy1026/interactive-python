# Interactive Python
These are completed exercises for Coursera courses: Interactive Python I and Interactive Python II provided by Rice University.  The professors did a great job making these classes/lessons applicable and fun.  

One important note:  All these excercises were completed, submitted and evaluated on codesculptor.org, a more minimalist version of iPython/Jupyter Notebook.  So, they don't always run under native python environment (yet).  May be one day I will get around to refactor all of them to do so.  

Lastly: Codes were written in Python 2.7.  

Thank you for reading.
